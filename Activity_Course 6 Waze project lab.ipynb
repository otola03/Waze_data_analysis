    "The XGBoost model made more use of many of the features than did the logistic regression model from the previous course, which weighted a single feature (`activity_days`) very heavily in its final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anything, this underscores the importance of feature engineering. Notice that engineered features accounted for six of the top 10 features (and three of the top five). Feature engineering is often one of the best and easiest ways to boost model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that the important features in one model might not be the same as the important features in another model. That's why you shouldn't discount features as unimportant without thoroughly examining them and understanding their relationship with the dependent variable, if possible. These discrepancies between features selected by models are typically caused by complex feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.\n",

    "1. If it's used to derive business decisions, no. It has low scoers to be used that way, especially poor recall score. However, it it's used for further exploratory efforts, then it might be of use. \n",
    "2. Making a validation set means there is less amount of training set. However,  performing model selection on a separate validation set enables testing of the champion model by itself on the test set, which gives a better estimate of future performance than splitting the data in two ways.\n",
    "3. Logistic regressions are easier to interpret. They reveal coefficient for each feature, but also directionality of weight. They tell you if each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the target variable in the model. \n",
    "4. Tree-based models are often better predictors. They not only often perform better but also require less data cleaning and fewer assumptions about the underlying distributions of the predictor variables. \n",
    "5. Maybe new features could be engineered to generate better predictive signal. \n",
    "6. More drive-level information (drive times, locations, etc) and more data about how users interact with app would be helpful. Like, how often do they use feature A or feature B? "
